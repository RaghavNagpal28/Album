# Album
This project consists of the owrking of a album with its front end in HTML, CSS and Javascript. The server side scripting is done in PHP and the data is stored and retreived from JSON files.
The project is not complete as the server side scripting is not integrating properly with front end, I tried AJAX and several Jquery plugins but I am having some problems with upload and delete part of images.
MySQL plugins was another thing that I tried but there was a runtime error.
Please help me out in fixing this project.
